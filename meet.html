          <p class="page-content">Hey there, nice to meet you. I'm Brennan. This may be the closest we'll get to meeting each other so let's make the most of it with a quick rundown. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I'm of Portuguese and Lebanese descent. When I was younger, I had a small speech impediment and was inherently shy because of it. Because of this, I never got to learn Portuguese or Arabic from a young age as my parents were focussed on speaking to me in English. The speech therapist recommended this. Thanks a lot. So now I'm practicing and learning my Portuguese and hope to be fluent within the near future. I grew to appreciate what we had. I also grew to value the world we lived in. Buildings, automobiles, technology. It was fascinating to me. This growing appreciation only deepened and today I have a strong interest in computer programming and creating applications. It connects people and in this scenario, I like to be the facilitator. I admire architecture, old and new, infastructure, and all types of industries. I try to think of how software can speed this up and someday whether it be tomorrow, a year, or four from now, be the one who made an impact on something in this world.</p>
